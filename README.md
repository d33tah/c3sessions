c3sessions
==========

The goal of this project is to provide a convenient interface that shows
self-organized sessions running on 36th Chaos Communication Congress. The
reason I wrote it was that I wasn't happy with all the other scheduling
applications and I really wanted to have the entire list on my screen.

This application includes a 36C3 wiki scraper that I wrote because I didn't
realize that all of the data is already available as a JSON. Oh well.

Oh, and here's a screenshot:
